    <!-- Hi and thanks for translating!
If you see anything that is surrounded with symbols just like this text, that is, within !- and - (but with 2 dashes, I cannot write it here), then do not translate.
These are comments to help you understand what to do or the context the next word is used in.

Entries that need to be translated will look something like this:
<string name="yes">yep</string>

Do not translate the word in quotes (in this case "yes").  This is a name that we use to look up your translation.
But DO translate the word or sentence between the greater than and less than signs.  In this case "yep".

For example, if you were doing a French you might do this replacement:
<string name="yes">oui</string>

Try to not make your translation a lot longer than the english, or it might not all fit in the space the app has on screen!


If, in the part you are supposed to translate, you see a percent sign and a word, like this: %foo, then do not translate it.  For example:

<string name="delQ">Delete account "%accountName" (on %blockchain)</string>

What is happening here is that the app will replace %accountName with the actual name of the relevant account and %blockchain with the actual name of the blockchain.
So it will look like this in the app:
  Delete account "myNexaAct" (on Nexa)

You can change the order of the replaced words just by moving where the %word is in your translation.  For example, I could change this to:

<string name="delQ">Delete from %blockchain, account "%accountName"</string>

Good luck!

For user protection, accounts protected by PINs are not visible until the correct PIN has been entered (it is not indicated if a wrong PIN has been entered).\n\nIf you want to restore an existing NEXA account, provide the recovery phrase.
